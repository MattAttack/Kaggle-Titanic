# Kaggle-Titanic
Repository for the Kaggle Titanic Problem.  Files in the R/ directory are for exploring the data set.  Run with
```
$ Rscript explore.R
```
We aren't using a virtualenv, because numpy/scipy/sklearn don't install cleanly, so installation will be a little 
fussy.  Probably if you are using anacondas you'll be fine.
